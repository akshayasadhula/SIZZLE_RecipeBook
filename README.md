# 🍳 Mise — AI-Powered Recipe Book

**Mise** is a web application that lets you store, manage, and discover recipes — powered by AI. The name comes from the French culinary term *"Mise en Place"* meaning **"everything in its place"** — just like a professional chef organizes everything before cooking, this app helps you organize your recipes, discover new ones with AI, and plan meals with ingredients you already have.

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Firebase for real-time data and Groq AI for intelligent features.

## 🤖 How AI Works

All AI features use the **Groq API** with the **Llama 3.1** model called directly from the browser.

```
Browser → Groq API → Response → UI
```

- Each feature uses a different system prompt to control AI behavior
- Recipe features return structured JSON that fills the form automatically
- Chatbot maintains conversation history array for context memory
